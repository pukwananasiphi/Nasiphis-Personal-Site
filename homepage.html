            <h3> Profile</h3>
            
            <p>My aspiration is to be a great full-stack Application Developer...
            <br>Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to excellence, as reflected by <a href="AcademicRecord.html">my academic record</a> .
            <br>My passion for the evolving IT has driven me to excel in modules such as Technical Programming and Development Software. 
            <br>In November 2022, I participated in a hackathon that was hosted by an ICT business incubator- <a href="https://www.thecortexhub.africa/">Cortex Hub</a>, in collaboration with Ctrack.
            <br> The exposure to such environment provided a pathway to gaining valuable industry experience, further enhancing my knowledge and skills in this field.
            <br> My goals include graduating with cum laude, being a full stack developer and creating an invention as my long-term goal. Moreover, I am excited about the prospect of
            <br> gaining hands-on experience through internships and vacation work. I am currently looking for a  practical exposure which aligns perfectly with my career aspirations, and I am eager to immerse myself
            <br> in dynamic and innovative working environment. Hopefully one day I will be one of your valuable employees.</p>
